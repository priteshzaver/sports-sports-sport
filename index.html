<p>There are three phases to every football game</p>
<h3>1. Offense</h3>
<h3>2. Defense</h3>
<h3>3. Special Teams</h3>
<h4>Offense:</h4>
<p>The goal of the offense is to score as many points as possible. The offense can score one of two ways:</p>
<h5>Touchdown!</h5>
<p>A touchdown is worth 7 points and the offense scores a touchdown when the ball carrier carries the ball across the goal line.</p>
<h5>Field Goal!</h5>

<p>If the offense gets close enough, but fails to score a touchdown, the offense may elect to kick a field goal.
    The center snaps the ball to a holder, who holds the ball in an upright fashion so that the kicker can strike the ball.
    If the ball carries between two yellow upright poles, the offense is awarded 3 points.
