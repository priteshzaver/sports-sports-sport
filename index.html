            <p class="lat_ps">His father, Michael Latifi, is a real success story. He reportedly earned his first dollar
                working at McDonalds and is now the owner of Sofina Foods. We think that young Nicholas will
                be just fine financially.

<p>If the offense gets close enough, but fails to score a touchdown, the offense may elect to kick a field goal.
    The center snaps the ball to a holder, who holds the ball in an upright fashion so that the kicker can strike the ball.
