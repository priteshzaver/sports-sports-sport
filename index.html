    <h2 class="kings-header-caption">Welcome to basketball hell</h2>
        <p class="kings-paragraph">The Kings were recently named the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/sacramento-kings-named-worst-franchise-in-professional-sports-by-espn/">worst franchise in professional sports</a> by ESPN. At least we won something.</p>
        <p class="kings-paragraph">The Kings have not made a playoff appearance since the 2005-2006 season, which is currently the longest playoff drought in the NBA.</p>
        <p class="kings-paragraph">The Kings are 9-2 since installing a giant purple laser on top of the arena.</p>
        <p class="kings-paragraph">Maybe this is our year???</p>
