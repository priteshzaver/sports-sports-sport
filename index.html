            <p class="lat_ps">He once finished in P7, and once qualified in P10. With a total of 9 career points, he's a
                legend.
            </p>
            <li class="lat_li">Family Cash Flow</li>
            <p class="lat_ps">His father, Michael Latifi, is a real success story. He reportedly earned his first dollar
                working at McDonalds and is now the owner of Sofina Foods. We think that young Nicholas will
                be just fine financially.

            <li class="lat_li">What's Next For This Young Billionare?</li>
            <p class="lat_ps">Uber? Lyft? DoorDash? This man is clearly made of speed, for speed. "Better ingredients,
                better pizza"?
                I'm seeing a Papa John's commercial in his future.
